write azure bicep code to deploy an azure data factory
Sure! Here's an example Azure Bicep code that can be used to deploy an Azure Data Factory:

bicep
Copy code
param dataFactoryName string
param location string

resource dataFactory 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories@2018-06-01' = {
  name: dataFactoryName
  location: location
  identity: {
    type: 'SystemAssigned'
  }
  properties: {
    repoConfiguration: {
      type: 'FactoryVSTSConfiguration'
      accountName: '<your-account-name>'
      projectName: '<your-project-name>'
      repositoryName: '<your-repository-name>'
      collaborationBranch: '<your-branch-name>'
      rootFolder: '<your-root-folder-path>'
      tenantId: '<your-tenant-id>'
    }
  }
}
This code defines an Azure Data Factory resource with a specified name and location. The Data Factory also has a system-assigned identity, which can be used for authentication purposes.

The repoConfiguration property specifies the type of repository configuration used by the Data Factory, as well as the repository account, project, repository, branch, and folder path. You'll need to replace the placeholders (<your-account-name>, <your-project-name>, etc.) with the appropriate values for your VSTS/Azure DevOps repository.

Note that this example code assumes that you have already configured your Azure Bicep deployment environment, including your Azure subscription and credentials.

include code for linked services, datasets and pipelines within the data factory
Certainly! Here's an updated example that includes definitions for linked services, datasets, and pipelines:

bicep
Copy code
param dataFactoryName string
param location string

resource dataFactory 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories@2018-06-01' = {
  name: dataFactoryName
  location: location
  identity: {
    type: 'SystemAssigned'
  }
  properties: {
    repoConfiguration: {
      type: 'FactoryVSTSConfiguration'
      accountName: '<your-account-name>'
      projectName: '<your-project-name>'
      repositoryName: '<your-repository-name>'
      collaborationBranch: '<your-branch-name>'
      rootFolder: '<your-root-folder-path>'
      tenantId: '<your-tenant-id>'
    }
  }
}

resource mySqlLinkedService 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/linkedservices@2018-06-01' = {
  name: 'MySqlLinkedService'
  properties: {
    type: 'MySql'
    typeProperties: {
      connectionString: 'Server=<your-server-name>.mysql.database.azure.com;Database=<your-database-name>;Uid=<your-username>@<your-server-name>;Pwd=<your-password>'
    }
  }
}

resource mySqlDataset 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/datasets@2018-06-01' = {
  name: 'MySqlDataset'
  properties: {
    linkedServiceName: mySqlLinkedService.name
    folderPath: 'MySql'
    schemaName: 'dbo'
    tableName: 'myTable'
  }
}

resource mySqlPipeline 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/pipelines@2018-06-01' = {
  name: 'MySqlPipeline'
  properties: {
    activities: [
      {
        name: 'CopyMySqlData'
        type: 'Copy'
        inputs: [
          {
            referenceName: mySqlDataset.name
            type: 'DatasetReference'
          }
        ]
        outputs: [
          {
            referenceName: 'BlobDataset'
            type: 'DatasetReference'
          }
        ]
        typeProperties: {
          source: {
            type: 'MySqlSource'
          }
          sink: {
            type: 'BlobSink'
            writeBatchSize: 100000
          }
          enableStaging: false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
In this updated example, we've defined a linked service for a MySQL database (mySqlLinkedService), a dataset that references that linked service (mySqlDataset), and a pipeline that copies data from the MySQL database to a blob storage account (mySqlPipeline).

Note that in the mySqlLinkedService resource, you'll need to replace the placeholders (<your-server-name>, <your-database-name>, <your-username>, and <your-password>) with the appropriate values for your MySQL database.

Also note that the mySqlPipeline resource references a blob storage account (BlobDataset) that hasn't been defined in this code snippet. You'll need to define that resource separately or replace it with the name of an existing blob storage dataset.




Barry Fridley
does this handle resource dependencies?
No, the example code I provided does not handle resource dependencies explicitly. However, you can define resource dependencies in your Azure Bicep code by using the dependsOn property.

For example, let's say that you have a storage account that you want to use as the sink for your pipeline. You can define that storage account as a separate resource in your code, like this:

bicep
Copy code
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
  name: 'myStorageAccount'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}
Then, in your pipeline resource definition, you can use the dependsOn property to specify that the pipeline should be created only after the storage account has been created:

bicep
Copy code
resource mySqlPipeline 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/pipelines@2018-06-01' = {
  name: 'MySqlPipeline'
  dependsOn: [
    storageAccount
  ]
  properties: {
    activities: [
      {
        name: 'CopyMySqlData'
        type: 'Copy'
        inputs: [
          {
            referenceName: mySqlDataset.name
            type: 'DatasetReference'
          }
        ]
        outputs: [
          {
            referenceName: 'BlobDataset'
            type: 'DatasetReference'
          }
        ]
        typeProperties: {
          source: {
            type: 'MySqlSource'
          }
          sink: {
            type: 'BlobSink'
            writeBatchSize: 100000
          }
          enableStaging: false
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
By including storageAccount in the dependsOn array, you're telling Azure Bicep to create the storage account before creating the pipeline.

You can include the dependsOn property in any resource definition where you want to specify a dependency on another resource.



Barry Fridley
can I deploy files into the storage account as part of the bicep deployment
Yes, you can deploy files into a storage account as part of your Azure Bicep deployment by using an ARM template deployment that includes a deploymentScript resource.

Here's an example of how to deploy a script file to a storage account as part of your Bicep deployment:

bicep
Copy code
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
  name: 'myStorageAccount'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}

resource fileShare 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/fileServices/shares@2021-06-01' = {
  name: 'myFileShare'
  dependsOn: [
    storageAccount
  ]
  properties: {
    quota: 1024
  }
}

resource deploymentScript 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts@2020-10-01-preview' = {
  name: 'deployFileToStorageAccount'
  location: location
  kind: 'AzurePowerShell'
  dependsOn: [
    fileShare
  ]
  properties: {
    azPowerShellVersion: '3.0'
    scriptContent: '
      $context = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName myStorageAccount -StorageAccountKey (Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myStorageAccount).Value[0]
      $fileContent = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes("Hello, world!")
      Set-AzStorageFileContent -Context $context -ShareName myFileShare -Path "example.txt" -Content $fileContent
    '
  }
}
In this example, we've defined a storage account (storageAccount) and a file share within that storage account (fileShare). Then, we've defined a deployment script resource (deploymentScript) that uses PowerShell to write the contents "Hello, world!" to a file named example.txt within the myFileShare file share.

The dependsOn property of the deploymentScript resource includes a reference to fileShare, indicating that the script should be run only after the file share has been created.

When you run your Azure Bicep deployment, it will include the deployment script and will execute the PowerShell code to create the file in the storage account.




Barry Fridley
what if I have an existing, large CSV file that I want loaded into a blob container in my storage account
If you have an existing, large CSV file that you want to load into a blob container in your storage account as part of your Azure Bicep deployment, you can use the Azure Blob storage REST API to upload the file.

Here's an example of how to upload a large CSV file to a blob container in your storage account using a deploymentScript resource:

bicep
Copy code
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-06-01' = {
  name: 'myStorageAccount'
  location: location
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
  kind: 'StorageV2'
}

resource container 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/blobServices/containers@2021-06-01' = {
  name: 'myContainer'
  dependsOn: [
    storageAccount
  ]
  properties: {
    publicAccess: 'None'
  }
}

resource deploymentScript 'Microsoft.Resources/deploymentScripts@2020-10-01-preview' = {
  name: 'uploadCsvToBlobContainer'
  location: location
  kind: 'AzurePowerShell'
  dependsOn: [
    container
  ]
  properties: {
    azPowerShellVersion: '3.0'
    scriptContent: '
      $context = New-AzStorageContext -StorageAccountName myStorageAccount -StorageAccountKey (Get-AzStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myStorageAccount).Value[0]
      $container = "myContainer"
      $blobName = "myLargeFile.csv"
      $localPath = "C:\myLargeFile.csv"
      $blockSize = 4*1mb
      $containerSas = New-AzStorageContainerSASToken -Context $context -ExpiryTime (Get-Date).AddHours(1) -FullUri -Name $container -Permission rwdl
      $uri = $containerSas.AbsoluteUri + "&comp=block&blockid="
      $fileStream = [System.IO.File]::OpenRead($localPath)
      $bytesRead = 0
      $blockCount = 0
      $blockIds = @()
      while ($bytesRead -lt $fileStream.Length)
      {
          $blockId = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.BitConverter]::GetBytes($blockCount))
          $buffer = New-Object Byte[] $blockSize
          $bytesRead = $fileStream.Read($buffer, 0, $blockSize)
          $blockData = $buffer[0..($bytesRead - 1)]
          $blockLength = $bytesRead
          $uriWithBlockId = $uri + $blockId
          Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uriWithBlockId -Method Put -Headers @{ "x-ms-blob-type" = "BlockBlob"; "x-ms-version" = "2019-02-02" } -Body $blockData -UseBasicParsing
          $blockIds += $blockId
          $blockCount++
      }
      $uri = $containerSas.AbsoluteUri + "&comp=blocklist"
      $blockList = "<BlockList>"
      foreach ($blockId in $blockIds)
      {
          $blockList += "<Latest>$blockId</Latest>"
      }
      $blockList += "</BlockList>"
      Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Method Put -Headers @{ "x-ms-blob-content-type" = "text/csv"; "x-ms-version" = "2019-02-02" } -Body $blockList -UseBasicParsing
    '
  }
}
In this example, we've defined a storage account (`storage




Barry Fridley
how would I include an Azure KeyVault, secrets in the KeyVault and make sure the data factory uses the keyvault?
To include an Azure KeyVault in your Bicep deployment, you can use the Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults resource type. Here's an example:

bicep
Copy code
resource keyVault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2021-06-01-preview' = {
  name: 'myKeyVault'
  location: location
  properties: {
    sku: {
      name: 'standard'
    }
    tenantId: tenantId
    accessPolicies: [
      {
        tenantId: tenantId
        objectId: objectId
        permissions: {
          secrets: [
            'get'
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
In this example, we've defined a KeyVault resource named myKeyVault, assigned it the standard SKU, and added an access policy that grants the objectId (which represents a user, group, or service principal) permissions to get secrets from the KeyVault.

To add a secret to the KeyVault, you can use the Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets resource type. Here's an example:

bicep
Copy code
resource secret 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2021-06-01-preview' = {
  name: '${keyVault.name}/mySecret'
  properties: {
    value: 'mySecretValue'
  }
}
In this example, we've defined a secret resource named mySecret within the myKeyVault KeyVault, and assigned it the value mySecretValue.

get an access key for the storage account and put it in the key vault at deployment
To get an access key for the storage account and put it in the KeyVault at deployment time, you can use the following steps in your Bicep template:

Declare a variable to hold the name of the access key:

bicep
Copy code
var storageAccountAccessKeySecretName = 'storage-account-access-key'
Add a resource block to create a storage account:

bicep
Copy code
resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2021-04-01' = {
  name: 'mystorageaccount'
  location: 'eastus'
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_LRS'
  }
}
Add an output block to output the storage account key:

bicep
Copy code
output storageAccountKey string = listKeys(storageAccount.id, '2021-04-01').keys[0].value
This block uses the listKeys function to get the access keys for the storage account and outputs the first key value as a string.

Add a resource block to create a secret in the KeyVault:

bicep
Copy code
resource keyVaultSecret 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2019-09-01' = {
  name: storageAccountAccessKeySecretName
  properties: {
    value: output storageAccountKey
  }
  dependsOn: [
    storageAccount
  ]
}
This block creates a secret in the KeyVault with the name specified in the storageAccountAccessKeySecretName variable and sets the value to the output of the storageAccountKey output block. The dependsOn property ensures that the secret is created after the storage account.

Note that you'll need to provide the appropriate permissions for the Bicep deployment to access the KeyVault. You can use an Azure AD service principal with appropriate permissions, or you can grant permissions directly to the deployment user (if you're deploying from the Azure portal).





Barry Fridley
Outputs should not contain secrets and this potentially exposes sensitive information. Is there a more secure way to retrieve and store the storage access key in a key vault with Bicep code?

You're correct that exposing sensitive information in the outputs block can be a security risk. Instead of using outputs to retrieve and store the storage access key in a KeyVault, you can use the Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2019-09-01 resource to store the storage access key securely in the KeyVault.

Here are the steps to modify the Bicep code to store the storage access key securely in the KeyVault:

Create a variable to hold the name of the secret:

bicep
Copy code
var storageAccountAccessKeySecretName = 'myStorageAccountAccessKey'
This variable will hold the name of the secret that will be created in the KeyVault.

Add a Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2019-09-01 resource to create the KeyVault:

bicep
Copy code
resource keyVault 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults@2019-09-01' = {
  name: 'myKeyVault'
  location: 'eastus'
  properties: {
    sku: {
      name: 'standard'
    }
    tenantId: subscription().tenantId
    accessPolicies: []
  }
}
This block creates a KeyVault with the name myKeyVault.

Grant the Data Factory system-assigned managed identity access to the KeyVault:

bicep
Copy code
resource keyVaultAccessPolicy 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/accessPolicies@2019-09-01' = {
  name: 'myKeyVaultAccessPolicy'
  properties: {
    accessPolicies: [
      {
        tenantId: subscription().tenantId
        objectId: dataFactory.identity.principalId
        permissions: {
          secrets: [
            'get'
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
  dependsOn: [
    dataFactory
  ]
}
This block grants the system-assigned managed identity of the Azure Data Factory get permissions to the secrets in the KeyVault.

Use the managed identity to get the storage account access key:

bicep
Copy code
resource storageAccountKeys 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/keys@2021-04-01' = {
  name: 'myStorageAccount/keys'
  parent: storageAccount
}

var storageAccountAccessKey = storageAccountKeys.keys[0].value
This block retrieves the storage account access key using the system-assigned managed identity of the Azure Data Factory.

Add a Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2019-09-01 resource to create the secret in the KeyVault:

bicep
Copy code
resource storageAccountAccessKeySecret 'Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets@2019-09-01' = {
  name: '${keyVault.name}/${storageAccountAccessKeySecretName}'
  properties: {
    value: storageAccountAccessKey
  }
  dependsOn: [
    keyVault
  ]
}
This block creates a secret in the KeyVault with the name specified in the storageAccountAccessKeySecretName variable and sets the value to the output of the storageAccountAccessKey variable. The dependsOn property ensures that the secret is created after the KeyVault.

Note that you'll need to provide the appropriate permissions for the Bicep deployment to access the KeyVault. You can use an Azure AD service principal with appropriate permissions, or you can grant permissions directly to the deployment user (if you're deploying from the Azure portal).







To make sure your Azure Data Factory uses the KeyVault, you can use the linkedService resource type to define a linked service that uses the KeyVault. Here's an example:

bicep
Copy code
resource keyVaultLinkedService 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/linkedServices@2021-06-01-preview' = {
  name: 'myKeyVaultLinkedService'
  properties: {
    type: 'AzureKeyVault'
    typeProperties: {
      baseUrl: 'https://myKeyVault.vault.azure.net/'
      authenticationType: 'ManagedIdentity'
    }
  }
}
In this example, we've defined a linked service resource named myKeyVaultLinkedService of type AzureKeyVault. We've specified the base URL of our KeyVault, and set the authenticationType to ManagedIdentity, which means the linked service will use the managed identity of the Azure Data Factory to access the KeyVault.

You can then use the keyVaultLinkedService resource in your dataset and pipeline definitions, as appropriate, to reference secrets from the KeyVault. For example, to reference the mySecret secret defined earlier, you can use the following syntax in a dataset definition:

bicep
Copy code
resource myDataset 'Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/datasets@2021-06-01-preview' = {
  name: 'myDataset'
  properties: {
    type: 'AzureBlob'
    linkedServiceName: keyVaultLinkedService
    typeProperties: {
      ...
      connectionString: '@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://myKeyVault.vault.azure.net/secrets/mySecret/)'
      ...
    }
  }
}
In this example, we've defined a dataset resource named myDataset of type AzureBlob, and set its linkedServiceName property to keyVaultLinkedService. We've also used the @Microsoft.KeyVault expression syntax to reference the mySecret secret in the dataset's connectionString property.






Barry Fridley
how would I delete or reset the resources if I wanted to start over?
To delete or reset the resources created by your Bicep deployment, you can use the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell. Here are some examples:

To delete the Azure Data Factory and all its dependencies:

lua
Copy code
az deployment sub delete --name <deployment-name>
Note that this command will delete all resources created by the deployment, including the storage account and KeyVault if they were created by the deployment.

To delete just the Azure Data Factory and its dependencies, but leave the storage account and KeyVault intact:

css
Copy code
az deployment sub delete --name <deployment-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --yes
Note that this command assumes that the Azure Data Factory and its dependencies were created in their own resource group. If they were created in the same resource group as the storage account and KeyVault, you'll need to modify the command accordingly.

To reset the Azure Data Factory and its dependencies, you can redeploy the Bicep template with the same name as the original deployment. This will overwrite the existing resources with the new resources defined in the template.

css
Copy code
az deployment sub create --name <deployment-name> --template-file <template-file> --parameters <parameter-file>
Note that this command assumes that the deployment uses parameter files to supply values for the parameters. If you supplied parameter values directly on the command line when you deployed the template originally, you'll need to modify the command accordingly. Also note that this command will overwrite the existing resources with the new resources defined in the template, so any changes you've made to the resources since the original deployment will be lost.
